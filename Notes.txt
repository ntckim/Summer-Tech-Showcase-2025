Algorithm Vis:
    Just ask users to use a list of which nodes they visited in order
    Code that we will run to check that visited list with timeout logic if theres an infinte loop:
    ```
    import time, thread
    visited = []
    start_time = time.time()
    dfs_thread = threading.Thread(target=dfs, args=(visited))
    dfs_thread.start()
    while time.time() - start_time < 20000 and dfs_thread.is_alive():
       time.sleep(0.1)
    if dfs_thread.is_alive():
      print("timeout")
    return visited
    ```
