### 2. Create Environment File
In the root directory of this project, create a file named `.env`:

touch .env
```

Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_openrouter_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Replace `your_actual_openrouter_api_key_here` with your real OpenRouter API key.

### 3. Restart Development Server
If you're running the development server, restart it to load the new environment variables:

```bash
npm run dev
```
