## File Structure

```
src/pages/MockInterview/
â”œâ”€â”€ MockInterview.jsx      # Main component with dual view modes
â”œâ”€â”€ InterviewForm.jsx      # Form component
â”œâ”€â”€ openRouterService.js   # OpenRouter AI integration
â””â”€â”€ config.js              # Configuration (auto-loads from .env)
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the Mock Interview page
2. Upload your resume
3. Select target companies
4. Choose improvement areas
5. Add any additional notes
6. Click "Start Interview"
7. Review the 10 personalized questions
8. Navigate through questions using Prev/Next buttons or view all at once

## Security Notes

- **API Key Storage**: API keys are stored in `.env` files (not committed to version control)
- **Frontend Processing**: The current implementation exposes the API key in the frontend. In production, this should be handled server-side.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of OpenRouter's rate limits and usage policies.
- **Data Privacy**: Resume content is sent to OpenRouter's servers for processing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenRouter API key not configured"**
   - Follow the [SETUP_GUIDE.md](./SETUP_GUIDE.md) to configure your API key

2. **"Failed to generate questions"**
   - Verify your API key is valid
   - Check your OpenRouter account has sufficient credits
   - Ensure you're not hitting rate limits

3. **Resume not reading properly**
   - PDF files may not extract text content perfectly
   - Try using text or markdown files for better results
